<h3>About</h3>
🌟 Hi there! I’m Michael, a tech enthusiast with a passion for innovation and a knack for problem-solving. With a background in the military, I bring a unique perspective to the world of technology, combining discipline and a strong work ethic with a love for continuous learning.<br/><br/>

💻 My journey has taken me through various roles, from military service to recruiting, and now I’m diving deep into the tech realm. I’m particularly fascinated by the potential of AI and its ability to transform our everyday lives. I hold a CompTIA Security+ certification, which has equipped me with a solid foundation in cybersecurity principles.<br/>

🛠️ I thrive on tinkering with code, whether it’s crafting engaging web experiences using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, or diving into data management with Python and MSSQL Server. There’s nothing quite like the satisfaction of solving a complex problem or building something from scratch!

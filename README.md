<h6>Connecting these operating systems to local domain server:</h6>

<h6>Grub/Windows bootloader  (linux partition as /boot/efi)</h6>
1. How to change the orders when rebooting and startup operating systems.
2. Using linux commands for fedora, ubuntu when updating and changes are made.
3. After a few errors were notice I found some solutions on google, youtube video searches that correct the boot process. 

It's importants to document your solutions to reference it later.

(01/2025 - 04/2025)
Currently working on virtualization home-labs (Windows server 2022) on my linux machine using QEUM/KVM). 

Virtual Machines
----------------
1. Fedora41 workstation
2. Ubuntu 24.04 server
3. Win10home
4. Win10pro
5. Win11pro

Connecting them to my local domain server
1. Requires alot research after running into errors with different linux commands until it gets connected to windows server. 
2. Same process with windows computer that requires researches on how to connect a windows computer client the domain server. 
3. Learn that proper software depencies for both windows and linux must be installed prior or you cannot connect to the server network. 

----------------------------------------------------
Grub bootloader  (linux partition as /boot/efi)
Windows bootloader
1. How to change the orders when rebooting and startup operating systems.
2. Using linux commands for fedora, ubuntu when updating changes are made.
3. After running into a few errors I foud some solutions with google and youtube video's that I was able correct my boot process. 

I understand the basics of how and why its important to document your solutions and reference it later or bookmark the website links.
--------------------------------------------------
This was also a learning curve about partitions and know the correct partitions for your operating systems and amount of space to allocate for your desktop or laptop.  

This is my layout of my laptop partitions currently installed with the operating systems. The partition disks for linux and windows format 
1. ext4 (linux)
2. ntfs (windows)
